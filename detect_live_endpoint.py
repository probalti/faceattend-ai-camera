# It receives a single JPEG frame from the browser webcam (sent by
# AIScannerCard.jsx on the landing page) and returns YOLOv8 face boxes.
#
# Response shape the frontend expects:
#   { "faces": [ { "x": 55, "y": 40, "width": 150, "height": 150,
#                  "confidence": 0.93, "label": "face" }, ... ] }
#
# x, y, width, height must be in PIXELS of the frame you were sent
# (not normalized 0-1) — the frontend scales them to the on-screen video size.

# just to get the camera pipeline working end-to-end.

#   model = YOLO("yolov8n-face-lindevs.pt")
#   (download from https://github.com/lindevs/yolov8-face/releases)
# or your own FYP-trained weights — once you do, remove the
# `if int(box.cls[0]) == 0` class filter below, since a face model has
# no "person" class to filter by.
